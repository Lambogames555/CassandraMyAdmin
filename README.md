# 👋 Welcome to CassandraMyAdmin!

CassandraMyAdmin is a web panel designed to manage and administer Cassandra databases. Built with ASP.NET and ReactJS, it provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for performing various database tasks, such as creating and managing keyspaces, tables, indexes, and data manipulation. With CassandraMyAdmin, users can easily monitor database performance, run queries, and view database statistics. Although it's a new project in the early stages of development, the team behind CassandraMyAdmin is actively working on adding more features and improving the tool's functionality. Users can contribute to the project and help shape its development roadmap. Despite its early stage of development, CassandraMyAdmin has great potential as a powerful and user-friendly tool for managing Cassandra databases.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE

Please note that CassandraMyAdmin is currently in the pre-alpha stage of development, which means that it is still in the very early stages of development and is not yet a fully functional product. While the tool already offers some basic features for managing Cassandra databases, it is still being actively developed and refined.

## 🤖 Features

- ⚙️ Comprehensive Cassandra Statistics: Get detailed statistics and metrics about your Cassandra cluster's performance, including read and write latencies, compaction and repair activities, and node-specific information.

- 🆗 Host Overview: Gain a holistic view of all hosts in your Cassandra cluster, including their status, health, and connectivity.

- 🆗 Keyspace and Table Management: Easily manage your keyspaces and tables through an intuitive user interface. Perform actions such as creating, deleting, and modifying schemas with just a few clicks. Effortlessly navigate through the contents of your tables, explore data, and make modifications without the need for complex commands.

- ✔️ Effortless User Management: Simplify user management tasks by seamlessly adding, updating, and removing user accounts with appropriate privileges and access controls.

- ⚙️ Advanced Role Management: Plan and allocate roles efficiently by defining custom roles and assigning granular permissions to users or groups. Ensure the right level of access for each role within your Cassandra environment.

- ⚙️ Interactive Table Editing: Edit table rows directly within the user interface, providing a convenient way to update data without the need for complex queries or external tools.

- ⚙️ Robust Security with Captcha Protection and Fail2Ban: Strengthen the security of your Cassandra cluster's web panel, cassandramyadmin, by implementing both Captcha protection and Fail2Ban. Captcha protection adds an extra layer of defense by requiring users to complete a captcha challenge before accessing the web panel, effectively preventing automated bots and unauthorized entities from gaining access. In combination with Fail2Ban, which automatically detects and blocks suspicious or malicious activities, your Cassandra cluster is safeguarded against unauthorized access attempts and potential security breaches, ensuring the integrity of your data and system.

- ⚙️ Seamless Database Import: Simplify the migration process by easily importing data from legacy databases such as MySQL, allowing for a smooth transition to Cassandra while preserving existing information.

- ❓ Real-time Monitoring: Monitor the health and performance of your Cassandra cluster in real-time, with customizable dashboards, alerts, and notifications, empowering you to proactively address any issues and optimize system resources.

- ⚙️ Automated Backup and Recovery: Implement automated backup strategies to safeguard your data against accidental loss or system failures. Enable quick and efficient recovery options to minimize downtime and ensure business continuity.

- ❓ Scalability and Cluster Management: Seamlessly scale your Cassandra cluster by adding or removing nodes, rebalancing data, and managing replication strategies. Streamline cluster management tasks for enhanced scalability and fault tolerance.
